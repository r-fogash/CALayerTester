# CALayer Tester
This is a test projrct made for myself for a quick recapture on CoreAnimation's most used features, so, instead of writting every time a small project to play with some of the CA features, I can just drag some controls on the testboard (tab) and see how it works.

Currently the project contains a test board for:
- CAGradientLayer
- CA3DTransform 
- Line stroking
- Shadows

More test board will be added in the future.
